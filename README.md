# Custom_Sticky_Note_Tool
This is my personal (very simple) sticky note tool. It has some extra features that I enjoy that the regular Windows sticky note tool doesn't have.

I used to put all my notes and TODO items in a singular sticky note on my desktop. I don't like having multiple sticky notes open because of too many Windows. Here are some of the features I implemented:
- Automatic multi-layered bulleted list building. When creating notes, I don't want to have to press the button in the top right corner for a bulleted list, I just want to press '-' and get the list going efficiently.
- Here are some of the keybinds I implemented:
  - ctrl + x -- Deletes the current line
  - Alt + Shift + Down -- Duplicated the current line
  - Alt + Up -- Moves the current line up
  - Alt + Down -- Moves the current line down
  - Control + L -- Inserts a line divider ('-' * 100)

I will add to this as I learn what I want a bit more.

NOTE: Yes, I know this is a nearly useless tool and substitutes exist, but would I really be a software engineer if I didn't waste my time making my own how I like it?
